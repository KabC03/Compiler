In parse fn, should make sure functions have a MAP (not set) of name -> return type. Also function declaration should include a return type

int foo(int x, char y) {...} instead of fn foo(int x, char y) {...}


Currently working on register allocator - Need to save and load from stack



Then should work on expression handling (left to right)

Then declarations, redeclarations, while, if, etc
